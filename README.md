- Improve their skills  
- Act as mentors  
- Support new learners  

The platform should also reward career milestones, mentorship achievements, and learning goals.

> 💡 **Bonus:** We encourage all teams to integrate or plan some form of **AI feature**. AI is a hot topic and is likely to grow in relevance in the future.
